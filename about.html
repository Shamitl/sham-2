<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there !!!</p>

<p>My name is Xamitl Hernandez and I know , it's a cool name. You might think that Im from a wierd place due  my name 
  but actually Im from Mexico, the place where the tacos were invented, I think. Whatever, Im starting programming not 
  to long ago. Although I still have a lot to learn, Im actually having fun.
</p>

<p>Im supposed to be a Mechanical Electric Engineer, but due the pandemic I couldnt finish my carreer. My familiy 
  was going through a rough time so I decided to quick school and star working to at least support my self. I got 
  a promotion thanks to my hard work and I decided to continue working. After the pandemic ended my brother got into 
  promagramming and he told me how fun and really profitable It was,  so I decided to start programming too. And here I am. 
  Although I decided to star working , I only have to pass 6 more subjects to get all the credits and graduate, and Im planing 
  on doing it after I get a real good job. It might be hard but its not impossible.
</p>

<p>Im a responsable person, I really take my work seriouly so I always try to be on time. I like to commit my self with my job, 
  because I always think of it as an oportunity that some one gave me and the least that I could do , is to put the shirt on, and 
  do my best. When there is a lot of work , I try to stay a little more time to finish it or if I can't ended, at least I try to  advance all 
  I can.  Im a fast learner , I have been working in two companies by now, so I know that some processes change and new technologies 
  arrive, so I take my time to learn and master them achiving efficiency and quality in my work. Im really good with the team work
  I get a long with the people with no difficulties, I have been in customer service for a long time so I know how to deal with people
  and I have learn how important the comunication is in order to get a great team work. One of my deficiencies is that I get distracted 
  easy, thats why I try to always stay focus on what im doing and keep away things such as my cellphone or TV while Im working. I got more
  but Im a person that tries its best to live with them and to keep them away from my job. I have been working for 6 years now ,so I can say 
  That I know how to deal with them. But there is a lot to learn yet, so that's why Im learning how to program.

<p> I guess you saw my web site, so you already know that Im a big fan of the Star Wars franchise. Since I was a kid I really 
  enjoyed those movies, I grew up with the precuele trilogy, I know that a lot of people doesnt like this trilogy to much but 
  I really had fun with all the starships and laser fights, I considere my self a Jedi because I know that there is always a 
  peaceful path to solve problems.I enjoy watching anime and series too. I also like to read books and comics. I like punk rock music, 
  you know the classic SUM 41 kind of music. So this  preatty much summarizes all about me so if you have any Question...or job offer... 
  feel free to contact me.
